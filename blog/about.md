Devops Padawan, learning daily about new technologies, stacks, paradigms, tools.. This blog serves the purpose of both keeping a record of my daily findings while working with Continuous Integrations, and Continuous Delivery on many different tools and programming languages.

Even though I'm a python afficionado, I like to code in many different languages, though I'm a bit bias towards scripting languages.
